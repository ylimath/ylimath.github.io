I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Harbin Institute of Technology, working with Professor [[Chao Zhang]](http://homepage-hit-edu-cn-s.ivpn.hit.edu.cn:1080/zhangchao).
Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. at Shanghai University under the guidance of Professor[[Fengping Yao]](https://math.shu.edu.cn/info/1019/3040.htm). 
During my Ph.D. studies, I was a visiting Ph.D. student for one year under the supervision of Professor[[Iwona Chlebicka]](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~ichlebicka/).
