I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Harbin Institute of Technology, working with Professor [[Chao Zhang]](http://homepage-hit-edu-cn-s.ivpn.hit.edu.cn:1080/zhangchao).
Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. at Shanghai University under the guidance of Professor[[Fengping Yao]](https://math.shu.edu.cn/info/1019/3040.htm). 
During my Ph.D. studies, I was a visiting Ph.D. student for one year under the supervision of Professor[[Iwona Chlebicka]](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~ichlebicka/) supported by the China CSC Scholarship.

#### Research Interests
My research interests primarily concern the existence and uniqueness of very weak solutions to elliptic and parabolic equations with non-standard growth, 
including entropy solutions and renormalized solutions. I am also currently investigating the regularity of solutions to such equations.
